# Advent of Code - Day 05

## Setup

First make sure to have the OCaml compiler and its package manager installed, then run:

```bash
opam init
opam switch create .
opam install dune
```

Note that you may need to run `eval $(opam env)` inbetween or when you restart your shell.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
dune build
```

The executable will be located under `./_build/default/day05.exe`.
